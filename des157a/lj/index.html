    <h1><span style="background-color: #F43B86; font-weight: 900; letter-spacing: 3px; color: white;">Ch3 - Use of images and interaction on websites</span></h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Pictures are an important medium of communication with the audience. When it comes to websites, images play a huge role in gathering users' attention and conveying the intention in fewer elements. I studied the website of a media company which uses image thumbnails to showcase trailers of short movies and documentaries. It is called <a href="https://www.seventh.tv" target="_blank" style="color: #F43B86; font-weight: 800; font-weight: bolder;">Seventh TV</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The website uses users' mouse in innovatie ways. For example: as the user moves the mouse, the focus on the screen changes. Also, when an image is clicked, a bigger version is displayed on the screen. On this screen, the image has a play button to play the trailer of the documentary. One interesting thing for me was that the mouse pointer changes on this screen to a cross button to stop the video at any time. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The website also contains a gallery of images from the trailer which are very high quality. Overall I feel this website uses images very judiciously as well as beautifully to tell stories of people in minimal words.

    <h1><span style="background-color: #F43B86; font-weight: 900; letter-spacing: 3px; color: white;">Ch2 - Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</span></h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Modals (or Overlays) play an important part in various functions to be performed by user which helps the design communicate with them. They are like additional windows on top of the existing page. For many years, modals have been used to convey the need for user input, grab user's attention, show additional information etc. 
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a few important things to keep in mind when designing a modal window. Starting from a "close" button which is necessary so that the user is escape out of it. Another important element is giving a relevant title to the modal so as to convey the purpose to the user. It is very important to label the buttons for better readability. A modal should only be generated by user's actions and not on its own. When a modal opens on the screen, the background opacity should be reduced so as to focus the reader's attention on the subject. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, with modals, just like any other design, it is important to add accessibility. Deign considerations such as keyboard accessible, moving focus, closing the modal using keyboard etc. Another thing to consider is zoom in/out of the screen should resize and focus on the modal accordingly. With all these considerations, modals is a great tool to convey important information as well as focus users' attention to specific details.

    <h1><span style="background-color: #F43B86; font-weight: 900; letter-spacing: 3px; color: white;">Ch1 - Best Practices for From Design</span></h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Forms play a huge part in interactive user interfaces. And implementing best practices to create forms is very important from the design perspective. These practices come in all forms starting from working on the smallest elements such as labels and  size of text box to providing the required keyboard, placeholder text etc. Another important aspect is feedback which includes displaying error messages for the user in case of invalid inputs and highlighting the current input field.
        </p>

        <p>
            For me one of the most important feature in a form is labels and placeholder text. It helps me as a user to understand what is needed of me and what is the kind of text the form is looking for. Labels are a great way to communicate with the user. They play the role of instructions and make the user experience smoother. Placeholder text is another way to assist the user. A lot of times, in case of a card or a document with multiple numbers, it becomes difficult to figure out which number is for what and in that case, placeholder text acts as a sample text and can help the user understand what the form is asking for.
        </p>

        <p>
            Out of all the most recent forms that I have taken, I feel the <a href="https://campusready.ucdavis.edu/symptom-survey" target="_blank">UC Davis Symptom Survey</a> is a very simplistic form. It sticks to a single column layout. Has Yes/No boxes instead of drop down lists and works very well with both laptop as well as mobile. The form also highlights the selected option, providing feedback to the user. For me it was a great way to showcase form best practices because this is something which should be precise and quick as students and staff will be using it on a regular basis.
