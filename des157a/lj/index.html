        <p>
            Forms play a huge part in interactive user interfaces. And implementing best practices to create forms is very important from the design perspective. These practices come in all forms starting from working on the smallest elements such as labels and  size of text box to providing the required keyboard, placeholder text etc. Another important aspect is feedback which includes displaying error messages for the user in case of invalid inputs and highlighting the current input field.

            For me one of the most important feature in a form is labels and placeholder text. It helps me as a user to understand what is needed of me and what is the kind of text the form is looking for. Labels are a great way to communicate with the user. They play the role of instructions and make the user experience smoother. Placeholder text is another way to assist the user. A lot of times, in case of a card or a document with multiple numbers, it becomes difficult to figure out which number is for what and in that case, placeholder text acts as a sample text and can help the user understand what the form is asking for.

            Out of all the most recent forms that I have taken, I feel the <a href="https://campusready.ucdavis.edu/symptom-survey" target="">UC Davis Symptom Survey</a> is a very simplistic form. It sticks to a single column layout. Has Yes/No boxes instead of drop down lists and works very well with both laptop as well as mobile. The form also highlights the selected option, providing feedback to the user. For me it was a great way to showcase form best practices because this is something which should be precise and quick as students and staff will be using it on a regular basis.
