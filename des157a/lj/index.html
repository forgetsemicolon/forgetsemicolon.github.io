    <h1><span style="background-color: #F43B86; font-weight: 900; letter-spacing: 3px; color: white;">Ch5 - Game On!</span></h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            This journal entry is based on reading the article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099" target="_blank" style="color: #F43B86; font-weight: 800; font-weight: bolder;">Game Design UX Best Practices</a> by Amir Dori. It talks about different best practices as a game designer. It focuses on various small but impactful features involved in designing a game.
        </p>

        <p>
           The few things talked about in the article are positions, sliders, controlling the visibility of elements on the screen etc. It balances between the users needs and monetization requirements for such applications. One of the parts that I personally as a user feel is very good is the transparent background behind a pop-up and that on clicking on the background, we can exit out of it. This is a small feature but it makes the interface more user friendly. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Another cool thing that I learnt about is Dark UX. I had not noticed the way gaming interfaces are designed but reading this article made me realize that a major part of the design focuses on monetization. It largely involves users' psychology as well as habits. All game interfaces are similar but different. I feel incorporating these techniques in my design will help me make my game more user friendly.

            The above picture is more nature oriented. It looks like it was taken during a holiday in a small village. It has hills and valleys as well as a small lake with ducks. The picture seems to be taken during morning. The small cave-like structures under those grass hills look like hobbit houses. 
        </p>

        <p>
           The picture mostly consists of the color green but the background sky color seems pale as it has been edited. It is relatively less brighter. Due to perspective, the caves look small but they are really big since I can see the clothes drying in the background which appear to be very small. The place seems very pleasant with other people in the scenery who could be either other visitors or people who live there. The doors have beautiful colors as well and each of them is designed differently.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most obvious aspect of this image is the beauty of the place and the nature. It is lush green with clean air and seems like a peaceful place. The mysterious aspect is the people in the picture and where this picture was taken. Another mysterious aspect is the weather since the foreground makes it seem like a pleasant morning but the backgrounds feels like it is a gloomy afternoon.

            This picture was taken during the summer of 2021. I completed my first of Masters at UC Davis. I did not have an internship so I was mostly home by myself working on getting a full time job. For me personally, breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. I would do a nice workout and look forward to this yummy bowl of oatmeal. It was a lot of trial and errors while developing this beautiful bowl. And I don't think I can ever get bored of it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This image summarizes my summer. It was the best summer ever with lots of reading and oatmeals and desserts and coding : |  I want to use this image to show the final product in my recipe book. It looks very colorful and chocolatey and will encourage readers to try out the recipe! :P
        </p>

        <p>
            Through this image I wanto convey my love for food and all the colorful things. And how small things like a bowl of oatmeal can bring so much joy to one's life. Life is short and so put all the toppings while you can :)

    <h1><span style="background-color: #F43B86; font-weight: 900; letter-spacing: 3px; color: white;">Ch3 - Use of images and interaction on websites</span></h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Pictures are an important medium of communication with the audience. When it comes to websites, images play a huge role in gathering users' attention and conveying the intention in fewer elements. I studied the website of a media company which uses image thumbnails to showcase trailers of short movies and documentaries. It is called <a href="https://www.seventh.tv" target="_blank" style="color: #F43B86; font-weight: 800; font-weight: bolder;">Seventh TV</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The website uses users' mouse in innovatie ways. For example: as the user moves the mouse, the focus on the screen changes. Also, when an image is clicked, a bigger version is displayed on the screen. On this screen, the image has a play button to play the trailer of the documentary. One interesting thing for me was that the mouse pointer changes on this screen to a cross button to stop the video at any time. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The website also contains a gallery of images from the trailer which are very high quality. Overall I feel this website uses images very judiciously as well as beautifully to tell stories of people in minimal words.

    <h1><span style="background-color: #F43B86; font-weight: 900; letter-spacing: 3px; color: white;">Ch2 - Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</span></h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Modals (or Overlays) play an important part in various functions to be performed by user which helps the design communicate with them. They are like additional windows on top of the existing page. For many years, modals have been used to convey the need for user input, grab user's attention, show additional information etc. 
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a few important things to keep in mind when designing a modal window. Starting from a "close" button which is necessary so that the user is escape out of it. Another important element is giving a relevant title to the modal so as to convey the purpose to the user. It is very important to label the buttons for better readability. A modal should only be generated by user's actions and not on its own. When a modal opens on the screen, the background opacity should be reduced so as to focus the reader's attention on the subject. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, with modals, just like any other design, it is important to add accessibility. Deign considerations such as keyboard accessible, moving focus, closing the modal using keyboard etc. Another thing to consider is zoom in/out of the screen should resize and focus on the modal accordingly. With all these considerations, modals is a great tool to convey important information as well as focus users' attention to specific details.

    <h1><span style="background-color: #F43B86; font-weight: 900; letter-spacing: 3px; color: white;">Ch1 - Best Practices for From Design</span></h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Forms play a huge part in interactive user interfaces. And implementing best practices to create forms is very important from the design perspective. These practices come in all forms starting from working on the smallest elements such as labels and  size of text box to providing the required keyboard, placeholder text etc. Another important aspect is feedback which includes displaying error messages for the user in case of invalid inputs and highlighting the current input field.
        </p>

        <p>
            For me one of the most important feature in a form is labels and placeholder text. It helps me as a user to understand what is needed of me and what is the kind of text the form is looking for. Labels are a great way to communicate with the user. They play the role of instructions and make the user experience smoother. Placeholder text is another way to assist the user. A lot of times, in case of a card or a document with multiple numbers, it becomes difficult to figure out which number is for what and in that case, placeholder text acts as a sample text and can help the user understand what the form is asking for.
        </p>

        <p>
            Out of all the most recent forms that I have taken, I feel the <a href="https://campusready.ucdavis.edu/symptom-survey" target="_blank">UC Davis Symptom Survey</a> is a very simplistic form. It sticks to a single column layout. Has Yes/No boxes instead of drop down lists and works very well with both laptop as well as mobile. The form also highlights the selected option, providing feedback to the user. For me it was a great way to showcase form best practices because this is something which should be precise and quick as students and staff will be using it on a regular basis.
