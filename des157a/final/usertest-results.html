            <h3>User 1: Michelle</h3>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly;">
                <img src="user-images/Michelle1.jpg" alt="Michelle 1">
                <img src="user-images/Michelle2.jpg" alt="Michelle 2">

                <span style="background-color: black; color: #C95828;">Liked:</span> Michelle loved the overall design of the game. She was amused by sounds and the animations of the various elements. She also complimented the fluidity and the color scheme. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="background-color: black; color: #C95828;">Suggestions:</span> One of the major suggestions from Michelle was highlighting the current squid. Also, the mute/unmute button was a little bit confusing. I could also reduce the number of clicks for the re-game. She also suggested that I display the rolled value but that is something I feel might be redundant. All the other suggestions were great and I am planning to implement them.

        <div id="comp2" class="tabs">
            <h3>User 2: Guan</h3>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly;">
                <img src="user-images/Guan1.jpg" alt="Guan 1">

            <p>
                <span style="background-color: black; color: #C95828;">Liked:</span> Guan loved the theme. He also liked the animations of the balloon floating up. He was really fascinated with the airplane banner.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="background-color: black; color: #C95828;">Suggestions:</span> Just like user 1, Guan had similar suggestion about flipping the volume button. And also suggested that I reduce the repeated overlay.

        <div id="comp3" class="tabs">
            <h3>User 3: Adam</h3>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly;">
                <img src="user-images/Adam.jpg" alt="Adam 1">
                <img src="user-images/Adam2.jpg" alt="Adam 2">
            </div>
            <p>
                <span style="background-color: black; color: #C95828;">Liked:</span> Adam as well liked the game and had fun playing it. He liked the fluidity and the cohesiveness of the page. He had fun with the sounds. He found the blinking underscore animation really cool and liked the fact that the user was made aware that the total score for winning is 30.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="background-color: black; color: #C95828;">Suggestions:</span> Adam suggested that I improve the hierarchy of the elements so as to display the quit button lower on the page. Also, the dice rolls could be put on the top. Another thing that he noticed was when the game restarts, the volume setting also resets which is something that I can improve. One last general suggestion was that adding more interactivity could make the game more fun.
